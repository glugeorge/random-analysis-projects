We recommend copying those results into your own `ouput` folder to generate the right plots. In fact, it is probably best practice to just copy the entire contents of `Project 2 ` (the shared folder) for ease of running."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VhuZO3jhRlYC"},"source":["## Motivation\n","\n","In the paper, there were various ways the model was tested, including, but not limited to: restricting the training data to certain months, restricting the training data by size, and extending the model to other lake systems. As we saw, the model’s RMSE was significantly reduced across all testing schemas. However, LSTM models can become especially computationally heavy as layers, epochs, and data set sizes increase. So we'd like to improve the original model so that our new model would have faster speed while keeping a good performance. Based on this idea, a new evaluation method -- computation speed -- is introduced in our project.\n","\n","Another way to speed up/simplify the model is to train it on less data. One novel approach we took to do this was to train models with while neglecting the lower depths. We then want to observe to see if our depth-limited model can capture the whole depth profile as well as the original while only being trained with a piece of it. \n","\n","To achieve our goal, we planed to modify the original model in two directions and finally combine them together. One is to adjust the optimizer in the machine learning model, another is to find an optimal partial training depth that still allows for the capturing of the entire depth profile in its predictions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gwEmKptsAeza"},"source":["# Part 0.

see that although there is a small increase in test loss, our new model is significantly faster than the existing one. Next, we aim to make it even faster with a similar level of accuracy by training with a reduced amount of temperatures by depth. Some extra investigation of our multiple runs suggested that the variability in timing for the dynamic learning rate happens after the pretraining with the simulation data. Consequently, by training and validating with a smaller data set (from only using shallower depths), we can probably speed up the timing further.

due to a smaller influence of mixing at the bottom - i.e. the winds at the surface have a much smaller inflence on the temperatures near the bottom. As a result, we chose to neglect these temperatures in our training and validation process in our new model to see how it impacts prediction. Since there's less mixing at the bottom, we assume that this does not contribute as much to the energy conservation of the lake. We still increase the EC threshold variable to account for possible energies missing from the neglected lower layers, since as shown aboce, the variations at the bottom aren't completely zero. \n","\n","To evaluate our improved model that is trained on less data, we will compare it with the model that trains on the entire dataset. \n","\n","Since from the above plot the standard deviation of temperature drops significantly after around depth layer 30, we will choose that as our cutoff layer. \n","\n","We start by doing the usual pretraining.

It also does not need as much measured data to generate similarly accurate results. This offers a glimpse into how the predictive power of a physics guided deep learning model can not only predict temperatures over time, but perhaps over space as well. Some next steps would include reinvestigating the loss function to account for the neglection of basal layers, or using some kind of optimiser to determine minimal depths needed to attain a specific degree of accuracy in predictions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EFhKD7ZMpRqP"},"source":["## References\n","+ Read, J.
